# ibeacon heatmap demo
This app demonstrate accuracy of iBeacons inside of a room and tries to generate heat map using them.<br> 
Because of iBeacon's proximity error, we have to use some approximation method to increase the precision of our position.

Used iBeacon lib for distance https://github.com/alt236/Bluetooth-LE-Library---Android
